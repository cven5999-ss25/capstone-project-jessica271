## Methodological information

1.  Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:                                    Data collection was done in three stages:                                                              First, review of secondary sources' websites such as the national governments.                         Manual digitization of spatial features and temporal distribution. This included features like major roads.                                                                                           Lastly, technical validation  

2.  Methods for processing the data:                                                                       Data collection - interpolating - summarizing - integrating data

3.  Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the
    data:                                                                                               Spatial software (GIS)                                                                                 https://unep-wcmc.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=aa6dcedfbede4b2188f90cda23ae03d0&extent=-110.8169,-57.1842,148.812,59.0403

4.  Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: -

5.  Environmental/experimental conditions:                                                              The study collected weather and temporal data from the region. It expresses a concern for development corridors causing environmental pollution and sustainability issues in Africa.

6.  Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:                           
Cross-referencing sources for roost data - Compared multiple reports for example, government reports on infrastructure.                                                                                         Georeferencing accuracy - The digitize map helped in eliminating spatial errors.                       Data consistency checks before using any secondary data                                                Standardized data sources - For example, government reports and NASA Power weather data.
